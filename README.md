Geographical Sales Analysis: Evaluate sales distribution across various geographical locations (countries, states, cities) to identify high-performing regions.
Product Performance and Return Analysis: Assess the performance of different products, focusing on sales quantities, returns, and return rates. Identify products with high return rates and explore possible reasons.
Profitability Analysis: Calculate profit margins for different products and regions, identifying areas where profitability can be improved.

Sample Step: Creating a Product Performance Visualization

To visualize product performance, aggregate sales and returns data by product and create a bar chart showing sales quantities versus return quantities. This will help in identifying products with high returns relative to sales, guiding inventory and marketing decisions.
